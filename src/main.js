// Game Title: Bullet Time 
// Date Completed 5/3/20
// Creative tilt justifications: We are proud of how we implemented the powerup logics. We used a combination of collisions, booleans
//                               and variables to implement them. For example the invincibility detects if they have the the powerup
//                               then destroys any bullets that they run into while also tracking how long they have left with that powerup
//                               (Josh: "This took me so long to realize I could use overlap instead of collision, which kept pushing the player"). 
//                               We also implemented a bitmapFont to our menu which is something technically new and not shown by Nathan.
//                               We are also proud of our art assets. All of the sprites were made by the team. Ryan is proud of how the
//                               player sprite turned out (Ryan: "I suck at art but it turned out great :)") and Naisha is proud of how the 
//                               background looks.
